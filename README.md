# Hello-World
My 1st GitHub project. I'm kind of new to coding. I've taken a C++, and SQL courses at my local community college, as well as a Linux class, and a PC pro course which I recieved a certification. I'm now studing coding at teamtreehouse.com. I've finished the HTML basics and the CSS basics courses, and now I'm ready to put my knowledge to work.
